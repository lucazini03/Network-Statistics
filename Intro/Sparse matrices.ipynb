    "In this notebook will introduce you to the concepts of **sparse matrix representation**. This is a useful way to numerically represent matrices when the amount of zeros is really large. It ensures that such large matrices can still be stored into memory without causing errors. We will focus on the different sparse matrix formats that exist, and a Python library (called *scipy sparse*) that allows you to use sparse matrices."

    "As expected, running this code is not difficult. There is nothing big going on. However, try changing the value of $n$ to e.g. $n = 1000000$, and you will see an interesting error pop up. Apparently, a huge amount of RAM is being using to store such a trivial matrix. What is going wrong here? In essence, Python is trying to allocate a piece of memory for every entry of the matrix; even the zeros. We call this **full-format** storage of the matrix. Full-format storage wastes a lot of space to zeros, causing the memory to be completely flooded. The idea of sparse matrix representation is to only store non-zero values. In case of our trivial matrix, this will reduce memory allocation significantly."

    "Note that in the example above `colstart` needs to be a vector of size 1000001 since it needs to indicate for every column where it starts and ends with respect to the row index array. `colstart` begins with two zeros, since the first column is empty. The second entry in `colstart` is zero and the third is one. This means that the second column starts at index zero of `row` and ends at index one. This end index is not considered part of the column. Hence, this shows there is one nonzero entry in the second column. Its row-index is given by `row[0] = 0` and its value by `data[0] = 2`. Finally, all the other values in `colstart` are one, indicating that all other columns have that their nonzero values start at index one of `row` (which does not exist) and also end there, meaning all the other columns only contain zeros.\n",
