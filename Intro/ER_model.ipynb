    "The Erdős-Rényi model is one of the simplest random graph model that exists. It is interesting to study, since it allows you to investigate properties that we also see in other real-life network models in the simplest possible settings. Due to its simplicity, it also allows you to investigate why certain graph algorithms work or break down.\n",

    "The model has two parameters: $n$ and $p$. The graph is formed by considering the vertex set $V := \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$. Then, for each pair of vertices $i, j \\in V$ such that $i \\neq j$ we flip a coin with succes-probability $p$. If this coin lands on heads, then we add the edge $\\{i, j\\}$ to the edge set $E$ of the graph. If the coin lands tails, we do not add the edge. Once all pairs of vertices have been considered, the graph $G = (V, E)$ is the realization of the  Erdős-Rényi model."

    "Despite its simplicity, the Erdős-Rényi model has many interesting properties that we also see in real-life networks. For example, we can see in the Erdős-Rényi model that with relatively few (expected number of) edges we can attain pretty big connected components in the graph. It turns out that the largest connected component of the Erdős-Rényi model contains more that $\\varepsilon n$ vertices for some small $\\varepsilon > 0$ if we consider the model with $n$ vertices and an edge probability of $\\lambda / n$ with $\\lambda > 1$. Thus, we have a linear number of vertices in the largest connected component while the expected number of edges is $\\lambda n$ (which is also linear)."
